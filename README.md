# Preliminary Task: Junior Test Engineer

Hello! Following your advice about the need for data validation, I implemented the DataFrame validation library we discussed on the phone. To maintain the general style of the ETL process you wrote, I created an additional class for data validation without changing the core logic. This made the code more modular and easy to extend.

## How I implemented the tests
I decided to run the tests via Docker because I encountered several issues:

- difficulties with imports,
- incompatibilities between versions,
- and the desire to simplify the launch process for you.

Now, you can run all tests with a single command:  
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This makes the verification process stable and independent of your local environment.
In the project, I used both unittest and pytest to demonstrate my ability to work with different testing frameworks. I chose unittest for classic structured tests, and pytest for checking in a more modern style, given its flexibility and wide capabilities.

## Thank you for your attention! ðŸ˜Š
I hope you like the result. It was a great task and I tried my best to show my skills. I will be glad to show more of my capabilities in the future!
